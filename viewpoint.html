    <h1>About how we see things and how they actually are</h1>
    <p>
      One morning I was waiting for my train to go to work and I saw following view:
      <img src="images/raindrops.jpg" alt="raindrops">
      What I noticed was that some raindrops look brighter and some look darker. When I moved, the view of the raindrops changed and the ones which were darker became lighter and the other way around. My viewpoint changed how I saw them and raindrops are on their basis the same, bright and dark at the same time. How I perceived them was dependent from the angle or viewpoint which side they showed or how it looked for me.

      Isn't the same true for us people? At the very basis we are all the same. We all have some caracheristics we are proud of and some with which we are not. Every person perceives us differently and sees different parts of us. It is all dependent from their viewpoint, angle and experience, but we still remain who we are.</p>
