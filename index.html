  <h1>Important reserch that can change the way you look at your life</h1>
  <p>
    There are many reserach done on the things that are important to each one of us, and only if we knew about it, our lives would be forever changed. According to the American Medical Informatics Association it takes on average around 17 years for scientific reaserch which done in medical or mental health care practice and only small fraction of all the reserch that has been done makes it.

  <h2>What this means to us and why it is important?</h2>
  <p>
    Think about it. Researchers are working every single day and discovering many usful things that could change our thinking and our life only if we know about it. But we might never find out, unless you start reading scinetific journals, which most likely you will not do as people are sceard reading them and it is understandable. But reaserch can be interesting, it does not have to be boring. This website is intended to inform you about reaserch that I found interesting and useful in my life and that has changed me. Main aim of this website is to bring more awarness and maindfulness into our everyday life. If you take only 1 thing away and it makes you think more then my aim if fulfiled.

  <h2>How the idea was born?</h2>
  <p>
    Last year I swiched from Netflix TV series that were eating so much of my time and I realized that I am not learning anything, but instead lost hours and hours of my precious time. We are not here forwever, our time here is limited and I want to do something usful with it. One day I made a decidion and started watching documentaries. Guess what, I started to learn so many things and it chaneged my life forever. It thought me how to be more mindful and aware of my own actions and changed me and the way I think and look at life. And yes, I bacame vegan and it was because of the documentary in Netflix called <em>What the Health</em>. It made me think about what I am doing to myself and to the environment. Interestingly enough, I do not crave any of those things vegans do not eat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then after that when I run out of documentaries, I started to watch Ted Talks and from them I can tell I learned even more. I just love them, they are so inspiring and contain so much intersting and useful information. I look back and realized, how just one simple decision chaneged my life forever and I am so glad I made it. In one Ted Talk they talked about how many years it took for one brave woman to change that pregnant woman should not be exposed to X-RAY as this led to very severe problems with the babies and even to their deaths and what I learned striked me and shoked me very deeply. It took her 20 years to do it. Can you imagine, how much lives could have been saved and how many problems avoided if people would be aware of it. To see this Ted Talk <a href="#">click here</a>. Then I was writing an essay for my university as an assignment and I came around article which advised that only very small fraction of resarch actually affects the real world applications and on average it takes 17 years to happen and this seems unacceptable to me. This website is my effort to inform more people about reaserch done and make you aware of the discoveries hopefully in the more interesting way. If this makes even very small differnece in your life, the purpose of this website will be fulfiled.
   </p>
  <p>
    And yes, I am also a student of Psychology so reasearch is what we are suppose to read. I am also studying Astrology and Mudras or Hand Yoga and I am fascinated by all the hidden and unusual things. It has alredy made a differnece in my life and I hope it will make a differnce in yours as well.
