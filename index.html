  <h1>Dangers of <abbr title="Electromagnetic Fields">EMF</abbr> (Electromagnetic fields)</h1>
  <p>
    Electromagnetic fields are present nearely everywhere in our environment, but they are invisible to the human eye.
    Electromagnetic fields are areas of energy that surround electronic devices.
    <strong>Electric fields</strong> are created by differences in voltage and the higher the voltage the stronger will be the field. <strong>Magnetic fields</strong> is created when electric current flows and the greater the current, the dtronger the magnetic field. Electric field is present always, even when the electric current does not flow.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main aim of this website is to bring awarness of dangers of EMF which are are surronded on every day basis.
  </p>
    EMF are present everywhere in our environment but are invisible to the human eye. It imposes dangers to our health that we are not even aware of. There has been a lot of research done on this. Unfortunately it does take on average aproximately 17 years for research to be implemented in the real life and only very small amount of research done actually gets implemented. What this means to us? This means that we are not even aware of the dangers. We are exposed to it every single day even more. You might wonder if I am not able to see it, should I be worried and how and if it affects me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lately the biggest danger to our health is the WiFi and mobile phones as we are not even aware that it imposes danger to us. We would not even think that it affects us in any way, but the truth is, it does. And it is very harmful to our health.
  </p>
  <p>
   WiFi occupies radio frequency band on the electromagnetic spectrum between radio waves and microwaves. Mobile phones communicate by transmitting radio waves. There have been research done on the dangers.
  </p>
  <p>
    There have been a lot of reserch done over the years.
