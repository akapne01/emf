# Website made by Agi
This is a website made as part of CodeFirst:Girls project.
It is about EMF (electromagnetic fields) something we cannot see, but that does not mean that it does not affect us, it does. And these effects are not beneficial for human beings and harm us. We do not even think or know about it, so there has to be something done about it while it is not too late. This website is created to bring awareness to the dangers of EMF radiation that is all around us every single day more and more.
