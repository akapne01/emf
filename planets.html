    <h1>Planets</h1>
    <p>In Vedic astrology planets are called Grahas and this world in translation from Sanscrit language means seizing. Vedic astrology is only considering 2 luminaries: Sun and Moon, 5 visible planets: Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and 2 nodes of the Sun and Moon called Rahu or South Node and Ketu or North node. They are the eclipse points between the orbits of the Sun and Moon.</p>

    <h2>Luminaries</h2>
    <p>Luminaries are Sun and Moon. In astrology they are considered to be planets so I will be calling them planets. Only because of the Sun and Moon life on Earth is able to exist. In the sense these 2 are the most important planets in astrology and also on Earth. Because of the Sun we have a light and Moon is responsible for all nature cycles.</p>
